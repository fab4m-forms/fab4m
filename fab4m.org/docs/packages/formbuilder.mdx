# Form builder

The `@fab4m/formbuilder` package provides the basic building blocks to create a visual
form builder UI capable of constructing fab4m forms.

## Installing

Install `@fab4m/formbuilder` package.

```bash
npm install --save @fab4m/builder
```

The form builder is built using tailwind css, so you will need to have that installed as well.
Refer to their [documentation page](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for information on how to do that.

## Set up the form you want to edit
The form builder works with any [serialized](/guide/serializing) fab4m form, for example:

```jsx
import { crateForm, serialize, textField } from "@fab4m/fab4m";
const formToEdit = serialize(
  createForm({
    component: textField({ label: "First component" }),
    second: textField({ label: "Second component" }),
  }),
);
```

## Add the form builder context
Place any components that should edit the form within the `<FormBuilderContext>` component. This will
let you use the `useFormBuilder` hook to access and manipulate the form

```jsx
<FormBuilderContext form={formToEdit}>
/* You can use any part of the form builder in here. */
</FormBuilderContext>
```

## The FormComponents component

Start by adding the `<FormComponents>` component. This will give you a drag and drop interface
where you can drag your components around.

<Example source={FormComponentsExampleSource} example={<FormComponentsExample />} />

## Adding actions to each component

In the first step we're just able to drag the components around. The next step is to be able
to perform actions on them.

We do this by adding actions to each component:

<Example source={FormActionsExampleSource} example={<FormActionsExample />} />
