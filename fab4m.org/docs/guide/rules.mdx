# Component Rules

There might be situations where you want to optionally show or hide some components
depending on the input in other components. This is what component rules are for.

## Adding rules to a component

When defining your components you can add a list of rules that needs to be fulfilled
in order for the component to be visible:

<Example source={BasicRulesSource} example={<BasicRules />} />

## Rule groups

By default, rules are logically ANDed together.

You can use logical groups to override this.

<Example source={RuleGroupsSource} example={<RuleGroups />} />

Rule functions can also be nested:

```jsx
expensive: booleanField({
  title: "Do you think public transport is too expensive?",
  rules: [or([equals("city", "Gothenburg"), and([greaterThan("usage", 5), lessThan(10)]))],
}),
```

## Custom rules

You can use the callback rule to provide any logic you want for your form.

## Check out the widget library

Fab4m comes with several rules, check them out in the *Rule reference*. Also, check the *extension guide* on how to create your own widgets.
