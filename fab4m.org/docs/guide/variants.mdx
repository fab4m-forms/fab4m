# Component Variants

Component variants allows you to change all aspects of a form component based
on the state of the rest of the form.

While rules allows you to show and hide different component based on the form state,
variants let's you customize everything.

Here's a simple example where we make the form component required or not, depending
on the form state:

<Example source={RequiredWhenPresentSource} example={<RequiredWhenPresent />} />

## Variant selection

A variant array is evaluated in order, and the first variant where the rule passes
is selected. If you provide a component without a rule, it will always be selected.

<Example source={VariantSelectionSource} example={<VariantSelection />} />
