There are\\nmany solutions out there, but they tend to tailor to only part of the\\nproblem: validation, rendering, and so on.\\n\\nI set out to finally solve the problem once and for all. It took way\\nmore time than I anticipated, but here it is!\\n\\nWhat are the highlights then?\\n\\nInstead of working directly with markup, you structure your form using a javascript object:\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport { createForm } from \\"@fab4m/fab4m\\";\\nconst form = createForm({\\n    title: textField({ label: \\"Title\\" }),\\n});\\n```\\n\\nThis makes it easy to build your structure however you like without having to think about how to structure the markup.\\n\\nThe form is made up from [components](/docs/guide/define-a-form). The component describes one part of the form and the data that it contains.\\n\\nEach component can have different widgets. The widget is responsible for rendering the component:\\n\\n```\\nconst form = createForm({\\n    title: textField({ label: \\"Title\\", widget: optionsWidget({}, [\\"one\\", \\"two\\"] }),\\n});\\n```\\n\\n\\nIn addition to this there\'s also [validators](/docs/guide/validators) and visibility rules to make it easy to validate your form.\\n\\nFab4m allows you to easily validate form submissions anywhere. You can generate a [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) from any form.\\n\\nThe whole form structure can be [serialized](/docs/guide/serializing) so that it can\\nbe stored easily.\\n\\nThere are many more features, have a look in the [docs](/docs/intro) and try it out!"}]}')}}]);
